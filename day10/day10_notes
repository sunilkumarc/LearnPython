1. open() method to open an existing file or create a new file.
2. Different modes when opening a file. 4 Modes:

    "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
    "a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
    "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
    "x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

3. Read Files:
    - open() using 'r' mode.
    - read()
    - readline()
    - readlines()
    - close()

4. Write Files:
    Two modes:
        - 'w' (write mode):
            - create a file if not exists
            - will overwrite any content if exists
        - 'a' (append mode):
            - create a file if not exists
            - will append the content to the existing file

5. Create Files:
    'x' mode

6. Delete Files
One realworld scenario:
    - create a temporary file
    - do some operations on it
    - delete the file

    - database, d1 (100k records)
    - python code reads data from database
        SQL queries -> takes more time if data is huge
        100k -> 1 second
        1 billion -> 1 day
    - put the read data into temporary files (100k)
    - use this temporary file to insert data into another database, d2
    - delete the temporary file
